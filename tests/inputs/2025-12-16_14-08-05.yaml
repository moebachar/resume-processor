  About the job
  
  Octopus Energy is a global energy leader revolutionising the way people use energy. We're not just an energy supplier; we're a tech company building a cleaner, smarter energy future.
  
  
  
  
  The Global Energy Markets team makes sure we always have the electricity and gas we need to power our customers’ homes and businesses, while also supporting the grid to accelerate the transition to Net Zero.
  
  
  
  
  To deliver on this mission, we are looking for an analytical Data Engineer to join the Energy Markets Engineering team and help us build efficient tools, pipelines and dashboards to ensure critical forecasting, trading, risk and PPA processes continue to run like clockwork.
  
  
  
  
  Given the scale of Octopus Energy’s growth across Europe, we are looking for a candidate with strong experience and understanding of electricity and/or gas trading across one or more EU markets who’s excited about building relationships between globally-centralised and local teams.
  
  
  
  
  This is a chance to take on a role that blends complex data engineering, platform infrastructure, and business-critical problem-solving, all while helping transform the energy industry for the better.
  
  
  
  
  What you will be doing...
  Supporting different Energy Markets teams to design and build key operational and reporting pipelines across all Octopus Energy global regions;
  Taking responsibility for the maintenance of these critical data pipelines supporting core trading, forecasting, risk and PPA processes;
  Developing automations and alerts to quickly debug where these pipelines are failing or showing unprecedented trends;
  Setting up and maintaining processes for capturing, preparing and loading valuable new data into the data lake;
  Designing and building dashboards that cover operational processes and reporting requirements;
  Working with international teams across the Octopus Energy Group to ensure everyone shares the best possible practises and code is standardised where possible;
  Taking ownership of data platform improvements that enhance the capabilities for all Energy Markets teams and drives trust in the stability of the setup;
  Sharing, enhancing and up-skilling team members on available tools and best practices
  
  
  
  
  
  What you'll have...
  Strong aptitude with SQL, Python and Airflow;
  Experience in kubernetes, docker, django, Spark and related monitoring tools for devops a big plus (e.g. Grafana, Prometheus);
  Experience with dbt for pipeline modelling also beneficial;
  Skilled at shaping needs into a solid set of requirements and designing scalable solutions to meet them;
  Able to quickly understand new domain areas and visualise data effectively;
  Team player excited at the idea of ownership across lots of different projects and tools;
  Passion for driving towards Net Zero;
  Drives knowledge sharing and documentation for a more effective platform;
  Open to travelling to Octopus offices across Europe and the US
