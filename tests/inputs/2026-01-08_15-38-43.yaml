  About the job
  
  Who We Are
  
  Artefact is a French consulting and engineering firm specializing in data and AI, and a leader in Europe. Headquartered in Paris, we are now present in 23 countries across all continents, with a team of 1,700 employees.
  
  Our mission is to help businesses unlock the full potential of AI and data by developing tailor-made solutions that address their specific industry challenges. As pioneers in this field, we combine technological expertise with operational excellence, working alongside the world’s leading market players. Our clients span all key economic sectors - industry, retail, luxury, consumer goods, healthcare, and finance - and include major international corporations.
  
  Beyond consulting, we are deeply committed to making AI ethical and accessible. We launched the Artefact School of Data to facilitate career transitions into tech roles and established AI Research Centers in Paris and Shanghai.
  
  What You Will Be Doing - Key Responsibilities
  
  As a Junior Analytics Engineer, you will :
  
  
  You will create data visualizations. You will work with either raw data or outputs from our models. Depending on the business context, you will find the appropriate visualizations that tell the right story.
  You will communicate your results to clients and other stakeholders. Even at a junior level, you might have to interact with clients quite a lot. With the supervision of a more senior person, you will craft presentations that transform your data analyses into engaging, nuanced narratives.
  You will extract significant insights and formulate recommendations from your data analysis. We tend to see data analysts / analytics engineers as a hybrid between data scientist and management consultant.
  You may oversee data quality and integrity aspects. For some missions, you might need to take some level of ownership of the data, although you will have a technical team that supports you along the way.
  You will learn how to set up ETL tools autonomously. While we don’t expect you to know this at the beginning, we’ll ensure that you’re able to use visual and programmable ETL tools so you don’t have to rely on data engineers. You will also learn basics in data processing and cleaning.
  You will learn how to interpret ML models. Our team of data scientists and engineers will need help making sense of the outputs of predictive and clustering algorithms. With Artefact, you may learn to interpret SHAP values, to make sense of Bayesian networks, and other advanced techniques.
  You will gain a wide range of data analysis and business consulting experience. You will be expected to work on a few missions a year (1-3), which will expose you to different industries, use cases, and technologies. Even within a mission, your day-to-day tasks might vary a lot!
  You will work with cutting-edge tools. Our stack varies from client to client, but is generally quite modern — GCP with Terraform, DBT, and Google Data Studio, to name a recent example.
  
  
  Qualifications - What We Are Looking For
