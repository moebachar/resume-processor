   About Mediterranean Food Lab
  
  Mediterranean Food Lab (MFL) is a Flavor company on a mission to shape the future of food through science‑driven fermentation and culinary creativity. Rooted in our culinary creativity, we craft natural flavours made from real foods that deliver authentic deliciousness to every dish.
  
  We are an AI‑driven startup, building advanced models that help us solve complex problems and accelerate innovation across our R&D pipeline.
  
  Our objective is to accelerate R&D cycles, democratize access to expert knowledge, and create better‑tasting, sustainable foods for global partners.
  
  
  
  
   Mission
  
  Build the software foundation powering MFL’s next-generation AI platforms.
  
   As an AI Software Engineer, you’ll design and implement scalable systems that integrate graph intelligence (Graph Data Base, Deep Learning algorithms) and LLM-powered reasoning into real-world production tools used by scientists, chefs, and product teams.
  
  This is a software-first role that bridges strong backend engineering with practical AI integration.
  
  
  
  
   Key Responsibilities
  
  Develop and maintain backend services (Python / FastAPI ) that connect AI models, data pipelines, and graph databases.
  Implement graph-based reasoning and embedding pipelines using Graph Data Bases and other DL algorithms frameworks (PyTorch/Tensorflow).
  Integrate LLM capabilities (prompting, RAG, fine-tuning).
  Design and deploy APIs enabling seamless interaction between model layers, data stores, and user interfaces.
  Collaborate with AI researchers and data engineers to bring applied models into production with robust inference systems.
  Ensure scalability and security across data flows and deployments; implement DevOps best practices (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD).
  
  
  
  
   Requirements
  
  4 + years in software development (Python, React / Angular).
  Familiarity with DL algorithms (PyTorch /TensorFlow.).
  Exposure to LLMs and prompt-based workflows.
  Hands-on experience with DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD Actions).
  Solid understanding of data structures, API design, and system architecture.
  
  Nice to have:
  
  Knowledge of MLOps and model deployment patterns.
  Interest in food science or creative AI applications.
  Experience with graph databases. 
  
   
  
   
  
  What We Offer
  
  The chance to shape MFL’s AI stack from the ground up.
  
  Work with an interdisciplinary team combining AI, data, and culinary innovation.
  
  Hybrid work setup (3 onsite + 2 remote) with modern Paris facilities.
  
  Swile meal card and a creative, collaborative environment.
  
  A real impact on how technology transforms flavor and food innovation.
