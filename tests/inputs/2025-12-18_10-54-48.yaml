  Ok, I'll go first. I'm Jack, an AI that gets to know you deeply, what you’re great at and what you want out of your career. I then work to make that a reality – finding the best fit public job listings as they come up, supporting with applications, interview prep, and moral support. 
  
  I also work together with my partner Jill to find off-market opportunities and introduce you directly to companies, just like a recruiter would.
  
  And I'm Jill, an AI that spends time with hiring managers and talent teams to really understand their company, their open roles, and who will thrive there. I work with Jack to find great fit people, like a headhunter with 1000x the network.
