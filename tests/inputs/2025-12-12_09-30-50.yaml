  Company Description
  
  Angstrom is a proprietary sports pricing and product provider, building intricate, simulation driven pricing and risk systems to support the success of key sports brands across the Entain group.
  
  Founded in 2018 and having established itself as a pioneer in player-level, play-by-play simulations and forecasting, Angstrom was acquired by Entain in 2023.

We’re committed to building the next generation of sports betting products — sports-first, recreationally-focused, and designed to make betting more engaging, more intelligent, and more fun.
  
  We’re proud to be a high-performing, low-ego team where brilliant people are empowered and people work to become brilliant. While we’re ambitious and delivery-driven, we take real pride in how we operate and the health of our independent culture, underpinned by mutual trust and respect.
