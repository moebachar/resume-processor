  At Picnic, we’re revolutionizing the way people buy groceries. Our affordable and sustainable service is made possible by our passionate people, cutting-edge technology, efficient planning, and, of course, our fleet of iconic electric vehicles! It’s why our customer base is growing rapidly across the Netherlands, Germany, and France.
  
  One of the things that makes Picnic different is that we handle almost everything in-house: forecasting, developing our first automated warehouse and new electric Picnic vehicles, internal and customer-facing applications—the list goes on. It gives us more freedom when it comes to trying out new and innovative ideas, which is something we do a lot!
  
  We love to challenge ourselves and learn new things. Our teams have access to various meetups, language classes, ‘Lunch & Learn’ sessions, our very own Tech Academy, and tailored soft-skills training. Professional development is as important to us as the service we provide to our customers.
  
  As a diverse team made up of over 80 nationalities, there are always plenty of activities to get involved with, whether you’re into sports, board games, charitable causes, dancing (at our legendary Picnic festival), or licorice tasting—yes, even that!
  
  Our scale-up culture means you get to own your role and bring fresh ideas to the table. So, if you’re looking for an opportunity to make a real difference, get in touch—we’d love to hear from you.
