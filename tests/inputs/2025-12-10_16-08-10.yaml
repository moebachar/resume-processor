  Diversity, equity, and inclusion
  
  Meet’s mission to be a highly successful life sciences recruitment company is inseparable from our commitment to Equality, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (EDE&I). 
  
  We champion EDE&I and embrace our employees, partners, and customers’ unique qualities and backgrounds in ethnicity, race, color, age, sex (including gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and pregnancy), religion, creed, nationality, ancestry, citizenship, veteran status, socio-economic status, physical and mental disability, genetic information, and any other category protected under federal, state, or local laws (“protected classes”).
